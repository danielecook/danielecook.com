Upvote.pub (https://www.upvote.pub) was a shortlived experiment to create a reddit-style clone specifically for scientific publications. Users could submit scientific publications from arXiv, bioRxiv, PubMed, or using a DOI. These submissions could then be upvoted or discussed using a commenting function (which also featured upvotes). I created the site because I like HackerNews and reddit, and I believe more dialogue regarding scientific publications would be a great thing.

The site was [featured on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16273171) and drew mixed criticims. There are some subreddits which provide similar functionality. I have open-sourced this project.
